## Bottom tabs
### _Camera_ tab
With this controls you can control the camera-view. You can rotate and move the camera freely and zoom in/out.

"Classic" flame fractals are flat (2D) and can not be rotated in space. Basically the parameters Roll, CentreX, CentreY and Zoom/Pixels per unit apply to them.
For 3D fractals there are a lot of more controls.

But, you can "mix" them, of course. So you can apply all parameters to any fractal and also rotating a 2D flame in space or apply a perspectiv distortion to it.  

#### _Roll_
Camera roll angle in degrees. Rotates around the virtual z-axis and also applies to 2D fractals.  
#### _Pitch_
Camera pitch angle in degrees.  
#### _Yaw_
Camera yaw angle in degrees.
#### _Bank_
Camera bank angle in degrees.
#### _Perspective_
Camera perspective. A value of 0 means no perspective, while higher value get more dramatic perspective effects. Can even be negative for more intersting effects.
#### _CentreX_
Offset (translation) of the fractal x-direction. 
#### _CentreY_
Offset (translation) of the fractal y-direction.
#### _Zoom_
Camera zoom.
#### _Pixels per unit_
Another (classic) measure of zoom. "Pixels per unit" means how many pixels are needed to fill a numerical distance of 1.0 (in fractal coordinates). The higher the value, the more details (like zooming in).   
#### _CamPosX_
Position of the camera in x-direction. Has a similar effect like CentreX for 2D fractals, but not for 3D-fractals. 
#### _CamPosY_
Position of the camera in y-direction. Has a similar effect like CentreY for 2D fractals, but not for 3D-fractals.
#### _CamPosY_
Position of the camera in z-direction.
