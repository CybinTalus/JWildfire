The Main Editor is the core part of JWildfire.
Here you create random flames or fine-tune your artworks.
It consists of the following parts:

 . Preview/Editor Area
 . Thumbnail ribbon
 . Transformations and Scripts
 . Flame settings
 . Global functions

You find a description of each part as separate sub-chapter in this manual.

## Preview/Editor area
This area is both for previewing fractals and editing them in realtime.
The most simple and intuitive way to edit a fractal is to drag or rotate one of the
visible controls on top of the fractals (usually in the shape of triangles).
But, there also much more precise ways and lots of other options to manipulate a flame-fractal.

### Quick buttons on the top of the preview area
This buttons primarily control the previewing/editing options.

#### _Display/hide variation effect_
Displays the contribution of the currently selected transformation (in the Transformations-area) in the form of a transformed grid.
For example, if the current transformation is a rotation, it will show a rotated grid.
If there are nonlinear transformations (=variations or "plugins"), then the displayed grid may change/deform much more.

#### _Display/hide transparency_
Switch preview-rendering with transparent background on or off.
Please note, that this only affects the preview display and does not the transparency setting of the flame itself.

#### _Fine edit_
Turn on or off "fine editing". Fine editing means that changes are less sensitive to changes using mouse or touchpad to allow editing with a higher grade of detail.

#### _Realtime_
Turns progressive rendering of the preview on or off. Progressive rendering means that the image starts to render in very low quality and gets improved after a while.
This image gets improved after a while again, and so on. Usually this works very good and allows a very fluid editing.
On slower machines (e.g. notebooks) this may cause a heavy load and on some fractals it may cause flickering.
Turning it off causes to render previews at lower and constant (non-progressive) quality level.

#### _Turn grid on/off_
Tuns on or off a grid which may help to align controls

#### _Turn guides on/off_
Turns on or off "artistic guides" for

 - center point
 - rule of thirds
 - golden ratio

which may help to find the right camera position/view.

## Flame settings
### _Camera_ tab
With this controls you can control the camera-view. You can rotate and move the camera freely and zoom in/out.

"Classic" flame fractals are flat (2D) and can not be rotated in space. Basically the parameters Roll, CentreX, CentreY and Zoom/Pixels per unit apply to them.
For 3D fractals there are a lot of more controls.

But, you can "mix" them, of course. So you can apply all parameters to any fractal and also rotating a 2D flame in space or apply a perspectiv distortion to it.  

#### _Roll_
Camera roll angle in degrees. Rotates around the virtual z-axis and also applies to 2D fractals.  

#### _Pitch_
Camera pitch angle in degrees.  

#### _Yaw_
Camera yaw angle in degrees.

#### _Bank_
Camera bank angle in degrees.

#### _Perspective_
Camera perspective. A value of 0 means no perspective, while higher value get more dramatic perspective effects. Can even be negative for more intersting effects.

#### _CentreX_
Offset (translation) of the fractal x-direction. 

#### _CentreY_
Offset (translation) of the fractal y-direction.

#### _Zoom_
Camera zoom.

#### _Pixels per unit_
Another (classic) measure of zoom. "Pixels per unit" means how many pixels are needed to fill a numerical distance of 1.0 (in fractal coordinates). The higher the value, the more details (like zooming in).   

#### _CamPosX_
Position of the camera in x-direction. Has a similar effect like CentreX for 2D fractals, but not for 3D-fractals. 

#### _CamPosY_
Position of the camera in y-direction. Has a similar effect like CentreY for 2D fractals, but not for 3D-fractals.

#### _CamPosY_
Position of the camera in z-direction.
