== Introduction
[.thumb]
image::JWildfire.jpg[scaledwidth=75%]

Welcome to JWildfire and this user manual!

The goal of this book is to describe the numerous function of the software and also to try
to explain how they work.
After over 10 years of development there is really a lot of this functions,
so the book is more a reference book than one you might read from start to end.

This book will not attempt to teach you how to create fractals and does not contain
tutorial materials or examples. This would be too much and will be part of another book
I will probably write.

Anyway, I'm hoping this book will help you to have more fun with the software and achieve
the results you are looking for.

Have fun!

== Fractal-Flame Editor
[.thumb]
image::main_editor_with_regions.jpg[scaledwidth=75%]
The Fractal-Flame Editor is the core part of JWildfire.
Here you create random flames or fine-tune your artworks.
It consists of the following parts:

. *Preview/Editor Area*
. *Thumbnail ribbon*
. *Transformations and Scripts*
. *Flame settings*
. *Global functions*

You find a description of each part as separate sub-chapter in this manual.

=== Preview/Editor area
This area is both for previewing fractals and editing them in realtime.
The most simple and intuitive way to edit a fractal is to drag or rotate one of the
visible controls on top of the fractals (usually in the shape of triangles).
But, there also much more precise ways and lots of other options to manipulate a fractal flame.

==== Quick buttons on the top of the preview area
[.thumb]
image::editor_buttons_top.jpg[scaledwidth=50%]

This buttons primarily control the previewing/editing options.

===== _Display/hide variation effect_
Displays the contribution of the currently selected transformation (in the Transformations-area) in the form of a transformed grid.
For example, if the current transformation is a rotation, it will show a rotated grid.
If there are nonlinear transformations (=variations or "plugins"), then the displayed grid may change/deform much more.

===== _Display/hide transparency_
Switch preview-rendering with transparent background on or off.
Please note, that this only affects the preview display and does not the transparency setting of the flame itself.

===== _Fine edit_
Turn on or off "fine editing".Fine editing means that changes are less sensitive to changes using mouse or touchpad to allow editing with a higher grade of detail.

[#realtime_preview]
===== _Realtime_
Turns progressive rendering of the preview on or off.Progressive rendering means that the image starts to render in very low quality and gets improved after a while.
This image gets improved after a while again, and so on.Usually this works very good and allows a very fluid editing.
On slower machines (e.g. notebooks) this may cause a heavy load and on some fractals it may cause flickering.
Turning it off causes to render previews at lower and constant (non-progressive) quality level.

===== _Turn grid on/off_
Tuns on or off a grid which may help to align controls

===== _Turn guides on/off_
Turns on or off "artistic guides" for

- *center point*
- *rule of thirds*
- *golden ratio*

which may help to find the right camera position/view.

===== _Style of editor controls_
You may select one of the following style of editor-controls:

- *axis*
- *crosshair*
- *rectangle*
- *triangle* (default)
- *hidden*

===== _Toggle monochrome/colored controls_
Per default each control is dran in its own color to make them more distinguishable.
Sometimes this may distract you from the fractal.Using this option, you may switch
to a less intrusive monochrome display of controls.

===== _Toggle post transform_
Quick-switch to toggle between editing of the affine-post-transform and the regular affine transform.

Longer explanation: Transformations are executed in the following order:

. *affine transform*
. *nonlinear transforms*
. *affine post-transform*

In the preview area you may either edit the affine transform or the post-affine-transform
by moving the visual controls with the mouse or touchpad.
This button is to switch easily between this two options.

==== Quick buttons on the right of the preview area
[.thumb]
image::editor_buttons_right.jpg[scaledwidth=50%]
This buttons primarily control the type of editing and refreshing the preview.


===== _Enable view editing mode_
In this mode you change the camera settings (=view) when dragging the mouse.

- using the mouse-wheel, you may zoom in/out.
- by dragging the mouse with the left mouse-button pressed, you move the camera.
- by dragging the mouse with the right mouse-button pressed, you rotate the camera.

===== _Move triangles mode_
In this mode you edit the affine or post-affine transformation when dragging the mouse.

- using the mouse-wheel, you may scale up/down.
- by dragging the mouse with the left mouse-button pressed, you move the control, causing a translation
- by dragging the mouse with the right mouse-button pressed, you rotate the control, causing a rotation.

===== _Rotate triangles mode_
This mode is similar to _Move triangles mode_, but you are restricted to rotations.
The rotation is done by dragging the mouse while pressing the left mouse-button.

===== _Scale triangles mode_
This mode is similar to _Move triangles mode_, but you are restricted to scale up/down.
This operation is done by dragging the mouse while pressing the left mouse-button.

===== _Enable free point editing_
In this mode you may freely edit the affine transform by dragging the three corner points
of the triangle-controls.
This way you can get easily create a fre combination of translation, rotation and shear.

===== _Edit view of the controls_
In this mode you edit the appearance of the controls.

- using the mouse-wheel, or by dragging the mouse with the right mouse-button pressed, you may scale them up/down.
- by dragging the mouse with the left mouse-button pressed, you move the controls

===== _Edit focus point_
Edit the focus-point (parameters FocusX, FocusY and FocusZ at the "DOF/Bokeh -> DOF" - tab)
using the mouse

- by dragging the mouse with the left mouse-button pressed, you change FocusX- and FocusY-parameters
- using the mouse-wheel you change the FocusZ-parameter

===== _Affine XY edit plane_
Sets the current editing-plane for editing affine-transform to the x-y-plane.

The editing of affine-transforms takes place in one plane, the default setting is the x-y-plane.
When editing "classic" 2d-fractals, the x-y-plane is the only plane.
But, when editing 3d-fractals, you may choose different planes, in order to modify all three coordinates.

===== _Affine YZ edit plane_
Sets the current editing-plane for editing affine-transform to the y-z-plane.

===== _Affine ZX edit plane_
Sets the current editing-plane for editing affine-transform to the z-x-plane.

===== _AI Denoiser preview_
Apply the currently selected AI denoiser (OptiX or OIDN) and display it in the preview.
This function uses a splitted preview, in order to allow to compare the denoised and the original image.
On the left side, you see the original image, on the right side of the splitting-indicator you
see the denoised image.

This function uses the current preview.So it is often recommended to re-render the preview in
higher quality before invoking it.

===== _External render preview_
Open an additional detached progressive preview, works especially well when you are using two monitors.

===== _Render image preview_
Re-renders the current preview with a much higher quality level.
This is a very important function in the fractal-editing workflow, because certain parameter changes
do not cause a complete re-render of the complete image, because this would be too slow.
Instead they use a raw in-memory-version of the latest preview and apply the parameter-change to it.

So, especially when fine-tuning colors it is recommended to re-render the preview in higher quality
using this button, before changing the settings.
Because this function is such important it is at this prominent place.

==== Quick buttons on the left of the preview area
[.thumb]
image::editor_buttons_left.jpg[scaledwidth=50%]
At this area you find some quick-buttons to reach other modules of JWildfire and the Undo/Redo-buttons.

===== _Interactive renderer_
This is just a shortcut for the Interactive Renderer.It opens it or brings it into foreground.
It does does nothing else, e.g. not to load the current flame into the Interactive Renderer.This is intended.

===== _Easy Movie Maker_
Opens the Easy Movie Maker.
Automatically adds the currently loaded flame as first keyframe inside the Easy Movie Maker when
there is no keyframe yet.

===== _Flame Browser_
Opens the Flame Browser.

===== _Undo_
Reverts the latest change to the currently selected flame.
Each flame has its own undo-history.So undoing a change will never switch between flames.

Please note, that the undo history is not saved together whith flames, so it is lost when
you quit JWildfire.

===== _Redo_
Repeats the latest undone change to the currently selected flame.

===== _SShot (Snapshot)_
Create a snapshot of the current flame.This is an identical copy with new undo-history.

===== _Title_
Sets the title of the current flame.This is a common place to also put copyright information
or to add your name (as the author of the artwork).
You can set a default title for flames, which are created using the
<<new_from_scratch, _New from Scratch_>>-button, by setting the
property *tinaDefaultNewFlameTitle* in the <<preferences, _Preferences_>>-window.

===== _3D_
Switch between "classic" rendering and experimental solid rendering.

Solid rendering basically works by remembering each sample of the fractal flame.
as a solid particle.
The sum of all of these particles make up a larger solid shape.
This works only good for a certain types of flame fractals.
It may fail if the structure is too thin or is in general too "chaotic" or too blurry.
Solid rendering can be used to create really unusual and interesting things.
Even to render the "classic" Mandelbulb (thanks to Whittaker Courtney for the idea):

[.thumb]
image::jwf_mandelbulb.jpg[scaledwidth=50%]

===== _Animations controls on/off_
Using this button you may quickly turn on or off animation controls on the fly.
You may set up your preference for this setting in the <<preferences, _Preferences_>>-window.

=== _Thumbnail ribbon_
[.thumb]
image::thumbnail_ribbon.jpg[scaledwidth=50%]

The thumbnail ribbon hold thumbnails of all flames you currently are editing.
After starting the program some random flame are generated and displayed in the thumbnail ribbon.
You can edit/view any flame of the thumbnail by just double-clicking it.
If you want to return to your previous flame just double-click the thumbnail of this other flame.
Each flame in the thumbnail-ribbon has its own undo-history.

[#selecting_flames_thumbnail_ribbon]
==== Selecting flames in the _thumbnail ribbon_
Each flame in the _thumbnail ribbon_ have a little checkbox assigned in the upper right edge.
By changing the value of this checkbox you change the selected state of the thumbnail.

Selection of individual flames is only important for saving and deleting.

[.thumb]
image::thumbnail_ribbon_select_menu.jpg[scaledwidth=50%]

By pressing the right mouse-button on top of this checkbox you can open a popup-menu
to change the selection for all flames inside the _thumbnail ribbon_:

 - *Toggle all*: invert the selection of all flames
 - *Deselect all*: set all flames to deselected state

So, one way to select all flames is to deselect them all and then to invert the selection.

==== Deleting flames in the _thumbnail ribbon_
Each flame in the _thumbnail ribbon_ has also a little delete-button assigned in the upper right edge.
By pressing this button you may delete the corresponding flame from the _thumbnail ribbon_.

[.thumb]
image::thumbnail_ribbon_delete_menu.jpg[scaledwidth=50%]

By pressing the right mouse-button on top of this button you can open a popup-menu
to delete a number of flames from the _thumbnail ribbon_:

- *Remove selected*: delete all flames, which are selected (the corresponding checkbox is checked),
from the _thumbnail ribbon_
- *Remove all*: empty the _thumbnail ribbon_

=== Flame settings
At this main tab you edit settings at the fractal-flame-level. Most of those options do
affect the final outcome in a global way, but do not affect the structure of the fractal itself.
E.g., you can change the view-settings or affect the final coloring, but not the shape itself or
which details are computed.

==== _Camera_ tab
[.thumb]
image::camera_tab.jpg[scaledwidth=75%]

With these controls you can control the camera-view.You can rotate and move the camera freely and zoom in/out.

"Classic" flame fractals are flat (2D) and can not be rotated in space.Basically the parameters Roll, CentreX, CentreY and Zoom/Pixels per unit apply to them.
For 3D fractals there are a lot of more controls.

But, you can "mix" them, of course.So you can apply all parameters to any fractal and also rotating a 2D flame in space or apply a perspectiv distortion to it.

===== _Roll_
Camera roll angle in degrees.Rotates around the virtual z-axis and also applies to 2D fractals.

===== _Pitch_
Camera pitch angle in degrees.

===== _Yaw_
Camera yaw angle in degrees.

===== _Bank_
Camera bank angle in degrees.

===== _Perspective_
Camera perspective.A value of 0 means no perspective, while higher value get more dramatic perspective effects.Can even be negative for more intersting effects.

===== _CentreX_
Offset (translation) of the fractal x-direction.

===== _CentreY_
Offset (translation) of the fractal y-direction.

===== _Zoom_
Camera zoom.

===== _Pixels per unit_
Another (classic) measure of zoom."Pixels per unit" means how many pixels are needed to fill a numerical distance of 1.0 (in fractal coordinates).The higher the value, the more details (like zooming in).

===== _CamPosX_
Position of the camera in x-direction.Has a similar effect like CentreX for 2D fractals, but not for 3D-fractals.

===== _CamPosY_
Position of the camera in y-direction.Has a similar effect like CentreY for 2D fractals, but not for 3D-fractals.

===== _CamPosY_
Position of the camera in z-direction.

==== _DOF/Bokeh_ tab
DOF (depth of field) is a kind of controversy topic in fractal flames.
Some people like it a lot (including myself),
some people do not like it at all.So, this sub-chapter describes a rather "special" topic.
Bokeh is some kind of art which utilizes DOF to achieve certain artistic effects (using a real camera).
Some typical types of bokeh-effects you may also simulate with JWildfire.

===== _DOF_ subtab
[.thumb]
image::dof_tab.jpg[scaledwidth=75%]

This tab contains some of the more basic settings regarding to DOF.

====== _New DOF_
Switches between classic and more sophisticated (="new") DOF mode.
Usually, the "new mode" is recommended.The classic mode is still ther because of backwards compatibility.

====== _Amount_
Amount of DOF.A value of zero means no DOF at all

====== _Area_
Measure of the sharp area around the focus point

====== _Exponent_
Measure of the falloff of the sharp area around the focus point

====== _Camera dist_
Only applies to the classic mode and is a measure of the distance of the camera to the focus point

====== _FocusX_
X-position of the focus point (point which is sharp).May also be edited interactively in the preview area.

====== _FocusY_
Y-position of the focus point (point which is sharp).May also be edited interactively in the preview area.

====== _FocusZ_
Z-position of the focus point (point which is sharp).May also be edited interactively in the preview area.

===== _Bokeh_ subtab
At this tab you can select options to create bokeh-like styles of DOF-effects.
Those options are not available when using solid rendering.For solid rendering there is an option to
apply post-bokeh effects, but those are limited in comparison to the options you find at this tab.

====== _Shape_
Selects the shape of the bokeh-effect

- *Bubble*: the typical and default shape
- *Cannabiscurve*: some nice-looking organic shape
- *Cloverleaf*
- *Flower*
- *Heart*: little hearts, makes nice Valentine-cards
- *NBlur*: has some interesting options to create very different shapes
- *Perlin Noise*: some unusual but interesting style
- *Rect*: very simple but effective style.You can also create "rain"-like scenes with this
- *SineBlur*: some popular circular bokeh
- *StarBlur*: tiny stars
- *Taurus*: some other unusual, but interesting shape
- *Snowflake*: a complex snowflake, created wtih the algorithm described in the
paper "A local cellular model for snow crystal growth" by Clifford A. Reiter.
- *SubFlame*: This is the most versatile option: You may use any other fractal as bokeh-style.

====== _Scale_
Global scale of the bokeh-shapes

====== _Rotate_
Global rotation-angle of the bokeh-shapes

====== _Fade_
Global falloff of the bokeh-shapes

====== _Shape specific parameters_
Depending on the bokeh-shape, there are additional parameters.
Most of them are the same as in the variation of the same name.E.g. the "Taurus"-bokeh-style has a
parameter N (which is the number of corners).The "taurus"-variation has the same parameter.
Not all parameters of a variation are exposed to the bokeh-style of the same name.

====== Flame (for the Sub-Flame-bokeh-style)
By this important parameter you select the flame you want to use as bokeh-style.
It is a number, starting with 1. BEfore you can use a flame as bokeh-style you must save it to your default
flame-folder by using a filename in the form *"_dof_XXXX.flame"*, where XXXX corresponds to the number
you select here.
For example, when you enter "23" as parameter Flame, JWildfire will look for a flame-file with the
filename *_dof_0023.flame*.


===== _Post bokeh_ subtab
[.thumb]
image::dof_post_bokeh_tab.jpg[scaledwidth=75%]
At this tab you can select options to create bokeh-like effects when using solid rendering.
Those options are only available in solid rendering and are limited to the bokeh-related options
which are available for regular flames.

====== _Bokeh intensity_
Overall amount/intensity of bokeh-effecs.

====== _Bokeh size_
Size of the bokeh-effects.The larger the effect, the more computation time is required.

====== _Bokeh filter kernel_
Type of bokeh-shape.The default setting produces "classic" flat circular shapes.

====== _Bokeh brightness_
Intensity of the bokeh in comparison the the original image.

====== _Bokeh activation_
Intensity level of the original image for placing bokeh "seeds".The larger the value the more seeds, the more bokeh.

===== _Post blur_ subtab
[.thumb]
image::dof_post_blur_tab.jpg[scaledwidth=75%]

Post-blur is not really a DOF-effect, but it creates also some kind of blur, therefore is is located at this tab.
It is not a popular option and primarily resides here for backwards compatibility.

Post-blur works by smudging each rendered sample of the fractal flame.
The effect diminishes the more far from the center.It usually makes a fractal appear more bold and "glassy".

====== _Blur radius_
Radius of the blur

====== _Blur fade_
(Inverse)intensity of the blur.The maximum value means maximum fade out, which is no blur effect at all.

====== _Blur falloff_
Strength of diminishing of the effect dependent of the distance to the center of the individual sample.

==== _Coloring_ tab
[.thumb]
image::coloring_tab.jpg[scaledwidth=75%]
At this tab you may edit numerous coloring/tonemapping options to turn your fractals into real artworks.

===== _Brightness_
Overall brightness level of the rendered image.For some fractals even very high values (above 20) may work nicely.

===== _Low brightness_
Measure to increase the brightness of areas with low sampling density.May help to reveal background details
of the fractals which would otherwise be hidden.

===== _Gamma_
Gamma correction level.Small values (below 2.5) increase the brightness of already bright areas and darken
already dark areas, causing some kind of glowing effect.

===== _Gamma threshold_
A density-threshold defining when to apply the gamma correction.In areas with a density below the
threshold a linear transformation is applied, while at areas with higher density the actual gamma
correction is applied.Playing with this value may also help to increase details of ares with low density.

===== _Contrast_
Overall contrast level of the fractal.Per default maximum contrast.In the most cases it should not be
necessary to alter this value, because lowering the contrast usually leads only to less appealing images.

===== _Red balance_
Overall red balance of the image.A convenient option for fine-tuning the final result without the
need to change the gradient.

===== _Green balance_
Overall green balance of the image.A convenient option for fine-tuning the final result without the
need to change the gradient.

===== _Blue balance_
Overall blue balance of the image.A convenient option for fine-tuning the final result without the
need to change the gradient.

===== _Fade to White_
A measure for the saturation-level of final colors.Can be used to achieve glowing-effects (decrease the value)
or to reduced glowing and make more details visible (increase the value).
Works similar to the gamma-value.

===== _Vibrancy_
Overall vibrancy-level (measurement of the number of different color values).Per default set to the maximum value,
which is very typical to fractal rendering.

===== _Saturation_
Saturation-level of the colors.A convenient option for fine-tuning the final result without the
need to change the gradient.

===== _Bg color_
Background-color which is mixed with the fractal in the forground to create a smoothly-looking final result.
There are the following options:

- *Single color*: one single color for the whole background
- *Gradient 2x2*: create a background by blending 4 colors at the corners of a rectangle
- *Gradient 2x2_c*: create a background by blending 4 colors at the corners of a rectangle and one color at the center

===== _Bg image_
Background-image which is mixed with the fractal in the forground to create a smoothly-looking final result.
Please note, that a background-image has higher priority than a background color.So, when choosing both,
only the background-image is rendered.


===== _Fg opacity_
Mixing-level of the Foreground (fractal) when applying a background-color or background-image.
Lower values make the foreground less transparent, but may increase antialiasing effects.

===== _Background transparency_
Turn on or off rendering with transparent background (alpha channel).This option is usually used when you
want to use your fractal images inside other software-package like Adobe Photoshop to compose a final
artwork out of different images or parts.
Please note, that you may also activate a preview of the background-transparency in
JWildfire (in the top area of the preview-window).

==== _Anti-Aliasing / Filter_ tab
[.thumb]
image::antialiasing_tab.jpg[scaledwidth=75%]
At this tab you find some very important settings which help to improve the visual quality or "cleanliness"
of your fractal artworks.
For details about filtering see the sub-section <<how_filtering_works, _Filter kernel preview / How filtering works_>>.

===== _Spatial oversampling_
Factor of spatial oversampling. Spatial oversampling works by internally rendering an image of larger size
and then creating a final of (usual) better quality by taking all this additional information into account.

 - a value of 1 means no spatial oversampling
 - a value of 2 means rendering internally an image of double size (double the width and double the height,
so it requires about 4 times of the memory)
- a value of 3 means rendering internally an image of triple size (triple the width and triple the height,
so it requires about 9 times of the memory)
- ...

The recommended value is 2.

Please note that, while higher levels of spatial oversampling require much more memory, they do not need much
higher rendering time.

===== _Filtering_
Global filtering strategy for building the final image by taking into account the fractal iteration information:

 - *Global sharpening*: create an image with consistent high sharpness
 - *Global smoothing*: create an image with consistent high smoothness
 - *Adaptive*: try to sharpen details, while smoothing "unsharp" areas as well as areas with low density

===== _Filter kernel_
Filter-kernel to apply, accordingly to the Filtering setting.

The following values are recommended (but feel free to play with other settings as well):

 - *Global sharpening*: *Mitchell-Filter*
 - *Global smoothing*: *Sinepow10*
 - *Adaptive*: *Mitchel_Sinepow* (*Mitchel*-Filter for sharpening details, *Sinepow10*-Filter for smoothing areas of low density)

[#how_filtering_works]
===== _Filter kernel preview / How filtering works_
Creating a fractal image is a elaborate process consisting of several steps.
Filtering is one of thse steps and very important for the final outcome.
It takes place after the iteration-process which creates a lot of individual "measure points" of the fractal,
called samples.

One pixel of the final image is usually created by taking into account a number of those raw samples.
This is some kind of averaging the neigbourhood and causes a better quality of the final image than just
using one sample per pixel (which also would works).


The filter-kernel-preview in the middle of the _Anti-Aliasing / Filter_ - tab show a visual representation of
this behaviour. Higher bars correspond to a higher influence of a sample, while lower bars correspond to a lower
influence.
Usually, the highest influence is in the centre, which makes sense because the sample at the position
of the final pixel usually should have an important influence.

====== _Example: Gaussian-filter_
[.thumb]
image::filter_preview_gaussian.jpg[scaledwidth=75%]
The Gaussian-filter is a very popular filter for smoothing. You can see understand this behaviour in
the preview:

 - the middle sample has the largest influence.
 - samples which have a certain distance to  the center, have a smaller influence.
 - this influence is smaller the more far the sample is.

====== _Example: Mitchell-filter_
[.thumb]
image::filter_preview_mitchell.jpg[scaledwidth=75%]
The Mitchell-filter is a very popular filter for sharpening.
In comparison to a smoothing filter, it has small areas with negative contributions, which
finally cause the sharpening effect.

====== _Example: Box-filter_
[.thumb]
image::filter_preview_box.jpg[scaledwidth=75%]

The box-filter is a special filter because it creates some kind of average of a bunch of samples.
You can see this clearly in the preview, having only bars of the same size, i. e. each sample has the
same contribution.

===== _Sharpness indicator_
This value helps the Adaptive filter to decide which portions of the image should be sharpened and
which should be smoothed.

The higher the value, the more areas are treated as smooth areas.
The lower the value, the more areas are sharpened.

This is a very abstract value, but there is a preview-mode which helps to visualize the different areas.
This feature is described in the sub-section <<adaptive_filter_preview, _Adaptive filter preview_>> .

===== _Low density_
This value helps the Adaptive filter to decide, which portions of the image should be treated as area
with low density, and which area should be smoothed regardless of density.

Usually, smoothing in areas of low density is more intense than in regular smoothing areas,
therefore the distinction.

The higher the value, the more areas are treated as low density areas.
The lower the value, the more areas are treated a general smoothing areas.

This is a very abstract value, but there is a preview-mode which helps to visualize the different areas.
This feature is described in the sub-section <<adaptive_filter_preview, _Adaptive filter preview_>>.

[#adaptive_filter_preview]
===== _Adaptive filter preview_
[.thumb]
image::filtering_show_indicator.jpg[scaledwidth=75%]
By enabling the small checkbox labelled "Indicator" and re-rendering the preview you get a visualization
of the different areas detected by the _Adaptive filter_ .

 - *red*: sharp areas
 - *green*: smooth areas
 - *blue*: areas with low density (which are also smoothed)

[.thumb]
image::preview_sharpness_indicator.jpg[scaledwidth=75%]

===== _Antialiasing amount_
Antialiasing is a technique to defend hard (or "jagged") lines or isolated pixels which seem too important.
It works by adding a little of "chaos" to the individual samples.
The _Antialiasing amount_ is a measure of this "chaos".
The higher the value, the more "chaos" is applied, causing less hard lines, but possibly also causing fewer
details.
See also _Antialiasing radius_ for another parameter to influence antialiasing.

===== _Antialiasing radius_
Radius of the added "Chaos" to avoid jagged lines. See _Antialiasing amount_ for a more detailed
description.

===== _AI-based denoiser_
Type of AI-based denoiser applied to the final image:filtering_show_indicator.jpg

 - *OptiX*: a very popular denoiser by NVIDIA, requires a modern graphics card from NVIDIA, see https://developer.nvidia.com/optix-denoiser
 - *OIDN*: an open-source-denoiser by Intel, comes with fewer requirements than OptiX, see https://www.openimagedenoise.org/
 - *None*: no post-denoiser

While not mandatory for rendering single images, those AI-based denoisers are extremely
helpful when it comes to render animations. By using an AI-based denoiser you can cut down
render times significantly, by factors of 10 and more.

This works by choosing a very low render quality in JWildfire (e.g. lower than normal by factor 10)
and than "completing" those usually noisy images by using the AI-based denoiser.
It is often amazing how good this works.
When you then finally assemble a compressed video sequence, you often see not difference in comparison
to render all frames in high quality.

Please note, that AI-based denoisers are not available on all platforms. Therefore, JWildfire performs
some self-test att startup and presents only the available options.

You can preview this feature using the _AI Denoiser preview_ - button in the preview area.

===== _OptiX filter blend_
This option is only available when choosing the OptiX denoiser. See _AI-based denoiser_ fr details.
It defines a blend between the original (noisy) image and the denoised image.

 - a value of 0 means that the original image is not blended with the denoised image at all, showing only the denoised image
 - a value of 0.5 would mean that there will be created an average of the original and the denoised image.

Usually, small values in the range 0 .. 0.2 are recommended.

You can preview this feature using the _AI Denoiser preview_ - button in the preview area.

===== _Denoise image_
Using this button you can denoise an external image using the currently selected AI-based denoiser.
When using the OptiX-denoiser, also the parameter _OptiX filter blend_ is respected.

This feature is useful when you want to play with different denoising-settings or forgot to enable
the denoiser or just want to denoise some non-Jwildfire-image.

Please note: It is recommended to use PNG as file-format, others may work as well, but are not
guaranteed to work. So, eventually you have to convert the image before denoising it.

==== _Gradient_ tab
At the gradient tab you find numerous option to create and modify the gradients of your fractals.
Notice: gradients are sometimes also referred as "palette" or "color palette".

===== _General controls_ subtab
[.thumb]
image::gradient_tab_general_controls.jpg[scaledwidth=75%]
The gradient-tab contains both some general controls and some sub-tabs.The former are described in this
sub-chapter.

====== _Edit gradient_ button
Opens/closes the classic gradient-editor of JWildfire.It is outdated and not described here.
This gradient editor was superseeded by the curve-editor you find at the _Curve editor_ subtab.

====== _Random_ button
Shortcut for creating a new random gradient (using the current settings at the _Create new_ subtab).
Gradient changes are also part of the undo-history of the fractal flame, so you may switch through
the randomly generated gradients by Undoing/redoing afterwards.

====== _Save_ button
Save the current gradient to the gradient-library (as *.map-file).
See the sub-chapter _Gradient library_ for futher details.

====== _Rnd grd_ button
Select a random gradient from your gradients-library.Per default, the built-in library is selected.
If you want to choose a random gradient from your own gradient-library or a sub-folder inside it, you
must select the right folder before.

====== _Shift_
Modifies the gradient-shift, which moves all colors by the given amount.
This is non-destructive operation.Colors, which are "moving out" at one end of the gradient
are "moving in" on the other side.

====== _Rnd shift_ button
Applies a randomly chosen _Shift_ value

====== _Rnd clr_ button
Sets the _Color_-parameter of all transformations of the fractal to a random value.

This does not change the gradient, but does change how it is applied to generate the
final coloring of the fractal.

====== _Rnd spd_ button
Sets the _Speed_-parameter of all transformations of the fractal to a random value.

This does not change the gradient, but does change how it is applied to generate the
final coloring of the fractal.

====== _Reset clr_ button
Sets both the _Color_- and the _Speed_-parameter of all transformations of the fractal to zero.

This does not change the gradient, but does change how it is applied to generate the
final coloring of the fractal.

====== _Distribute clr_ button
Distributes the _Color_-parameter of all transformations of the fractal evenly.

This does not change the gradient, but does change how it is applied to generate the
final coloring of the fractal.

===== _Gradient library_ subtab
[.thumb]
image::gradient_library_tab.jpg[scaledwidth=75%]

At this tab you can select pre-saved gradients and apply them to your fractal by just clicking
at them.
The gradient-library contains of two parts:

- in-built gradients: those are installed together with the program and can not be modified in any way
- your own gradients. They are located in a folder outside the JWildfire-installation-drawer,
  so that they are not lost when you update JWildfire. You must specify this path in the
  <<preferences, _Preferences_>> by setting the property *tinaGradientPath*.

User-defined gradients may be structurized in sub-folders in order to make them easier accessible.

===== _Create new_ subtab
[.thumb]
image::gradient_create_tab.jpg[scaledwidth=75%]

At this tab you can create gradients by various options.
The most common use is to create random-gradients by selecting one of the sophisticated built-in
random-gradient-generators.

====== _Random gradient_ button
Create a new random gradient using the currently selected options, which are described in the following sub-sections.
Each new gradient is a separate entry in the undo-history of the currently selected flame fractal, so you can
cycle through all the generated gradients by using the _Undo_ and _Redo_ button.

====== _Gradient generator_
You may choose on of the following gradient generators:

 - *(All)*: meta-random-gradient-generator which randomly chooses a random-gradient-generator to create the gradient
 - *Strong hue*: creates a smooth  gradient with strong colors
 - *Stripes*: creates a gradient with many regular color changes, having a "stripy" look
 - *Monochrome*: creates a smooth and monochrome radient
 - *Smooth*: creates a smooth gradient with primarily pastel colours
 - *Bold*: creates a non-smooth gradient with large blocks of strong colors
 - *Two colors*: creates a smooth gradient by fading exactly two colors into each other
 - *Uniform curves*: creates a random color curve with evenly distributed base colors and then
 derives the gradient from it. Using this generator you have both a gradient and
matching color curves.
 - *Uneven curves*: creates a random color curve with unevenly distributed base colors.
Using this generator you have both a gradient and matching color curves.
This setting creates usually the most interesting and versatile gradient together with the
corresponding color curves and is the default.

====== _Random points_
Number of random base colors to derive a gradient from. The more base colors, the more different
colors do you have in the final gradient.

Please note, that this setting is not respected by all
random-gradient-generators (e. g. _Two colors_ will always only use two colors).

====== _Fade colors_
Fade the base colors in order to create a smooth gradient, which is the default setting.

Please note, that this setting is not respected by all
random-gradient-generators (e. g. _Bold_ will never fade colors).

====== _Uniform widths_
Distribute the base colors over the size of gradient in an uniform way.

====== _Base colors_ table
In this table you can manually edit the base colors after a gradient was created.

Please note, that those base colors are not saved. So you can only edit them
at the time you create gradients, but not after saviong and loading a flame.

====== _Create similar gradient_ button
Creates another random gradient which has similar colors to the current gradient,
but has a different distribution over the area of gradient.

====== _Extract from flame_ button
Load a gradient from a flame-file.

====== _Create from image_ button
Imports an image and creates a gradient from the most frequent colors found in that image.

===== _Curve editor_ subtab
[.thumb]
image::gradient_curve_editor_tab.jpg[scaledwidth=75%]

Color curves are an alternative way to edit gradients.
Using color curves usually gives much more control over the final result because it allows
a very interactive editing of both the gradient and the flame at the same time.
Additionally, it allows more direct control over modifying the colors of a gradient,
making it much easier to create "dramatic" effects.

Internally, each gradient consist both of the "classic" part of the gradient and three
curves: *hue*, *saturation* and *luminosity*.
Those curves belong to the flames, and are also stored within the flame-files.

When loading an older flame-file without those curves, or assigning a "classic" gradient
to a flame, the color curves are approximated.
Usually, this  is only a very raw approximation, but this is absolutely intended.
To reach a very accurate approximation, it would require to have a lot of curve-points,
which would make the curve very hard to edit.
Therefore, the goal of the raw approximation is to make the actual editing easier.

So, there is no exact synchronisation between gradient and colors curves,
in order to not break existing flames and concepts.
Instead, it is meant as powerful additional tool, which is useful in very many cases,
but might not be useful in each case.

Only when you start to edit one of the curves, the gradient is synchronized to shape of the curves.
When you save and re-load a flame you can continue the editing of the curves.

Each curve has a toolbar with little buttons to help with editing:

  - open a modal dialog for editing an enlarged version of a particular curve
  - create ramp-shaped curve
  - create line-shaped curve at the bottom (constant zero intensity)
  - create line-shaped curve at the middle (constant halve intensity)
  - mirror the curve at the vertical axis
  - mirror the curve at the horizontal axis (e.g., to turn a constant line of zero intensity
into a line with maximum intensity)

===== _Modify gradient_ subtab
[.thumb]
image::gradient_modify_tab.jpg[scaledwidth=75%]
At this tab you can modify the gradient globally.
Please note, that this does not respect color-curves, so they will be out of sync, if any.

===== _Swap RGB_
Swaps the color channels which changes the finally colors dramatically.
Different values do swap different channels.

===== _Frequency_
Repeats the gradient inside itself. The higher the frequency the more copies are made.
Because the copies must fit in the place of one gradient, they are scaled down.

===== _Blur_
Blur smudges the colors of the gradient making it more smooth or "unsharp"

===== _Invert_
Turns the colors of the gradient into negative colors.

===== _Reverse_
Mirrors the positions of the colors (last color will be first and vice versa).

===== _Sort_
Sorts the colors by hue and brightness.

===== _Apply all current modifications_ button
All of the above options are "non-destructive" which mean they do not actually modify the gradient,
but are applied dynamically. Using the _Apply all current modifications_ button you can
finalize those changes by actually applying them to the gradient.

===== _Balancing_ subtab
[.thumb]
image::gradient_balancing_tab.jpg[scaledwidth=75%]
At this tab you can modify the colors of the gradient by applying typical color balancing operations.
Please note, that this does not respect color-curves, so they will be out of sync, if any.

===== _Red_
Change the red color balance.

===== _Green_
Change the green color balance.

===== _Blue_
Change the blue color balance.

===== _Hue_
Increase or decrease the hues of the colors of the gradient.

===== _Saturation_
Increase or decrease the saturations of the colors of the gradient.

===== _Contrast_
Increase or decrease the contrasts of the colors of the gradient.

===== _Gamma_
Apply an overall gamma correction.

===== _Brightness_
Change the overall brightness.

===== _Apply all current modifications_ button
All of the above options are "non-destructive" which mean they do not actually modify the gradient,
but are applied dynamically. Using the _Apply all current modifications_ button you can
finalize those changes by actually applying them to the gradient.

===== _Color map_ subtab
[.thumb]
image::gradient_colormap_tab.jpg[scaledwidth=75%]
At this tab you find a very experimental feature which lets you use an image as gradient.
It works only well for flat fractals.
When coloring the fractal it takes into account both the position at the (x,y)-plane and the local
color information from the iteration process.

===== _Select image_
Select an external image.

===== _H Offset_
Horizontal offset of the image map.

===== _H Scale_
Horizontal sizing of the image map.

===== _Local Add_
Measure of influence of local color information at the current position.

===== _Local Scl_
Measure of another type of influence of local color information at the current position.

===== _V Offset_
Vertical offset of the image map.

===== _V Scale_
Vertical sizing of the image map.

===== _Remove image_
Remove the selected color map (and revert to use a regular gradient for coloring).

[#solid_rendering]
==== _3D rendering_ tab
At this tab you can influence the outcome of a fractal rendered in solid mode.
This is also an experimental feature of JWildfire.

Solid rendering basically works by "remembering" each sample of the fractal flame
as a solid particle.
The sum of all of these particles make up a larger solid shape.
This works only good for a certain types of flame fractals and needs more rendering time
than "classic" fractal flames.

It may fail at all, if the structure is too thin or is in general too "chaotic" or too blurry.

Solid rendering can be used to create really unusual and interesting things.

===== _Ambient shadows_ subtab
[.thumb]
image::3drendering_ambient_shadows_tab.jpg[scaledwidth=75%]
Ambient shadow calculation is an effective method for approximating more complex physical processes
that cause it to be darker in small corner ends or crevices.

There are several methods to implements this, JWildfire uses a method based on
"Image-Space Horizon-Based Ambient Occlusion", which was developed by NVIDIA.

Ambient shadows are a global effect which is independent from any light sources.

====== _Ambient shadows_ checkbox
Enable or disable Ambient shadow calculation.

Please note that ambient shadows are applied after the main iteration process, so it will not be displayed
in realtime during progressive rendering.

====== _Amb shadow intensity_
Intensity of the ambient shadows. The higher the value the higher the darknesser the shadows in small corners.

====== _Search radius_
Distance to search for ambient occlusions.
Affects both the quality and the overall appearance of the ambient shadows.
Optimum values depends on the individual fractal. The default value should work not to bad in most cases, though.

====== _Blur radius_
Blur amount of ambient shadows. A value of 0 means no blur at all, which would look very unnatural.

====== _Falloff_
Falling off of the shadows. Higher values lead to higher falling off, making the shadows smaller.

====== _Radius samples_
Number of samples in radius-search-direction. Higher values increase both quality of the shadows
and rendering time.

====== _Azimuth samples_
Number of samples in azimuth-search-direction. Higher values increase both quality of the shadows
and rendering time.

====== _Affect diffuse_
An experimental option to let influence the diffuse lighting by ambient shadows.
This is in no way physically correct, but can help to generate more dramatic effects.

===== _Hard shadows_ subtab
[.thumb]
image::3drendering_hard_shadows_tab.jpg[scaledwidth=75%]
At this tab you can configure classic hard shadows which are geneated with the help of shadow maps.

Hard and ambient shadows can be used at the same time and work well together.

====== _Shadow type_
There are the following options:

 - *Off*: don't calculate hard shadows. This is the default setting
 - *Fast*: classic hard shadows
 - *Smooth*: a modification of hard shadows which smoothes them at the edges.
Produces artifacts in some cases. You should use then *Fast* shadows.

====== _Smooth radius_
Radius for smoothing hard shadows.

====== _Shadowmap size_
Resolution of the shadow map. The higher the resolution, the higher the quality of
the shadows, but the higher the memory consumption.

Please note, that a shadow map is required for each lightsource. So, having many light sources
may increase memory consumption indirectly, when using shadow maps.

====== _Shadowmap bias_
Sometimes shadow maps produces little stripy artifacts. By setting a small bias value those artifacts
can be bypassed. The bias value must not necessarily high when there are a large number of artifacts.

===== _Material settings_ subtab
[.thumb]
image::3drendering_material_tab.jpg[scaledwidth=75%]
Here you can set up the materials of your fractal.
Fractals can have any number of materials, which are selected by
a material-index similar to colors by the color-index.

====== _Selected Material_ combobox
Here you select the material you want to edit.

====== _Add_ button
Create a new material.

====== _Del_ button
Delete the currently selected material.

====== _Diffuse_
Amount of diffuse reflection which is light reflected from rough surface.
The color of this component is determined by the color of the lightsource.

====== _Ambient_
Amount of ambient light. The color of this component is determined by the fractal color.

====== _Specular_
Amount of specular reflection which is light reflected from a smooth surface.
The color of this component is determined by the _specular color_.

====== _Spec size_
Size of the specular reflections. Higher values produce smaller and more intense reflections.

====== _Diffuse response_
Controls how the material reflects diffuse light.

====== _Specular color_
Color of specular reflections.

====== _Reflection map_
Allows mapping an image as environment which is reflected on the object surface.

====== _Refl mapping_
The function used to map the image to the environment.

====== _Refl intensity_
Amount of light emitted by the reflection map.

===== _Light settings_ subtab
[.thumb]
image::3drendering_light_settings_tab.jpg[scaledwidth=75%]
At this subtab you may set up directional light sources for solid rendering.

You may have as many light sources as you want.

====== _Selected Light_ combobox
Select the light source you want to edit.

====== _Add_ button
Add a light source.

====== _Del_ button
Remove the currently selected lightsource.

====== _Altitude_
Changes the light direction by altering the angle between the light and the z-axis.

====== _Azimuth_
Changes the light direction by altering the angle between the light and the yz-plane.

====== _Light color_
Color of this light, used in the calculating the diffuse component of reflection.

====== _Cast shadows_
Choose if this light should cast shadows or not. Affects only hard shadows.

====== _Light intensity_
Intensity of the lightsource.

====== _Shadow intensity_
Intensity of the shadow casted by this lightsource.

===== _ZBuffer_ subtab
[.thumb]
image::3drendering_zbuffer_tab.jpg[scaledwidth=75%]
When rendering in solid mode, you may also export an additional z-buffer-image.
The settings on this tab help to customize the creation of this z-buffer.

Hint: To export an z-buffer you must activate the option _with Z-Buffer_ in the _Quality_-profile, you are using.
See the sub-section about <<quality_profiles, _Quality Profiles_>> for more details.

====== _ZBuffer scale_
Affects the amplitude of the z-shift/depth-effect caused the z-buffer.
The higher the value, the more dramatic the depth-effect caused by this z-buffer.

====== _ZBuffer bias_
Moves the minimal z-shift.

====== _ZBuffer filename_
There are two options to control how the filename of the z-buffer-image is determined:

 - *zbuf_name*: use image filename prefixed with "zbuf_"
 - *name_depth*: append "_depth" to the image filename

==== _Stereo3D_ tab
At this tab you can change options for rendering Stereo3D images.
There are many options here, including settings to generate classic anaglyph images
as well as options to generate interpolated images.

===== Stereo3d mode
Sets the type of Stereo3D mode:

 - *None*: no Stereo3D rendering
 - *Anaglyph*: the classic way to generate a Stereo3D image: creates one image for each eye,
turns them into gray, turns the gray into two different monochrome tones, and compose
those two images together.
Creates one image per frame.
Requires special 3d glasses with the matching colors to view the image.
 - *Side by Side*: creates one image for each eye and put them side by side.
Creates one image per frame.
 - *Interpolated images*: create a number N of interpolated images for each eye.
Creates 2 * N images per frame.

===== View angle
Angle between the eye-lines, also called Stereo angle.

===== Eye distance
Distance between the eyes.

===== Focal offset
Offset off the camera in z-direction.

===== Preview mode
Type of preview for Stereo3D-effect:

 - *None*: no Stereo3D-preview. The fractal flame is displayed like a regular fractal flame.
 - *Anaglyph*: preview as anaglyph image
 - *Side by Side*: preview in side-by-side mode
 - *Side by Side Full*: preview in enlarged side-by-side mode

*Please note, that the preview currently does not work correctly in Realtime mode.
When creating Stereo3d-images, it is recommended to <<realtime_preview, turn Realtime mode off>>*

===== Left eye color
Color of the left-eye-image in anaglyph mode. There are the following options:

 - Red
 - Cyan

===== Right eye color
Color of the left-eye-image in anaglyph mode. There are the same options as for the left eye.

===== Images per eye
Number of interpolated images which are created fopr each eye in _Interpolated Images_ mode.

===== Swap side
When checked, swaps the images for the left eye with the image for the right eye.
For some people is easier to see the 3D-effect this way, while for others is is easier the
other way.

==== _Post symmetry_ tab
???

==== _FPS / Motion blur_ tab
???

==== _Layers_ tab
???

==== _Channel mixer_ tab
???

==== _Quick mutations_ tab
"Quick mutations"-tab allow easily creating a batch of variations of the currently selected flame.
You may load any of those mutations into the main editor by double-clicking at it.
This creates a new flame in a new slot and does not alter the original flame in any way.
You may set the default batch size for quick mutations in the <<preferences, _Preferences_>> (property *tinaQuickMutationBatchSize*).
You may also set the default mutation-type for quick mutations in the <<preferences, _Preferences_>> (property *tinaQuickMutationDefaultMutationType*).

[#quick_mutation_types]
===== _Mutation type_ combobox
Here you can choose the type of mutation to be executed:

 - *Add transform*: add a random transformation
 - *Add variation*: add a random variation to a randomly selected transformation
 - *Affine*: randomly change parameters of the affine part of a randomly selected transform
 - *Affine3D*: randomly change parameters of the affine part in all three dimensions of a randomly selected transform
 - *Bokeh*: add a randomized bokeh-effect
 - *Change weight*: randomly change the weight of randomly selected transformations
 - *Color type*: randomly change the color-type of randomly selected  transformations
 - *Gradient position*: randomly change the color-parameter of randomly selected  transformations
 - *Local gamma*: add randomized local-gamma-effects
 - *Random gradient*: create a new random gradient
 - *Random parameter*: change some randomly selected parameters of randomly selected variations
 - *Random ztransform*: randomly change parameters of the affine part primarily affection the z-axis of a randomly selected transform
 - *Similar gradient*: create a similar gradient
 - *Weighting field*: add randomized weighting-field-effects
 - *All*: randomly select one of the above mutations. This is the default option.

 - *User1*, *User2*, *User3*: user-defined lists of mutations. You may customize them in the <<preferences, _Preferences_>> by
editing the properties *tinaMutaGenMutationTypesUser1*, *tinaMutaGenMutationTypesUser2* and *tinaMutaGenMutationTypesUser3*

==== _Batch size_
Here you can specify the number of create quick mutations.
In some cases in may make sense to use a large number. So you can create a huge batch of quick mutations with
one click and then view them later.

=== Transformations and Scripts
???

=== Global functions
At this area you find global functions as well as the very often used ones.

==== _Random batch_ button
Create a new batch of random flames and displays it in the _thumbnail ribbon_.
This is probably one of the most popular features of JWildfire, because using this function
you can create endless beauty in a very relaxing way. It is also very unlikely that you will
ever generate two fractals which look exactly the same, so it possible that you
are surprised by new and interesting results even after weeks of use of the program.


Please note, that this will per default remove any previously loaded flames together
with their undo-history from memory. So, any change you did not save yet, will be lost.
You can change this behaviour by editing the parameter *tinaRandomBatchRefreshType* in
the <<preferences, _Preferences_>>.

The random-flame-generating-process can be influenced by changing the following parameters:

 - *Rnd flame-generator*
 - *Rnd Symmetry*
 - *Rnd Gradient*
 - *Rnd WField*
 - *tinaRandomBatchSize* (in the <<preferences, _Preferences_>>)
 - *tinaRandomBatchBGColorRed*, *tinaRandomBatchBGColorGreen*, *tinaRandomBatchBGColorBlue* (also in the <<preferences, _Preferences_>>)

All of these parameters may be combined freely to create customized random flames. See the following sub-sections
for more details about these parameters.

===== Example of combination of parameters for creating specific random flames

For example, to generate mandala-like-structures which look very organic and have a yellowish background, you could
use the following setup:

 - *Rnd flame-generator*: *Simple (stunning)*
 - *Rnd Symmetry*: *Point*
 - *Rnd Gradient*: any
 - *Rnd WField*: *(All)*
 - *tinaRandomBatchBGColorRed*: *235*
 - *tinaRandomBatchBGColorGreen*: *215*
 - *tinaRandomBatchBGColorBlue*: *75*

[.thumb]
image::rnd_flame_gen_mandala.jpg[scaledwidth=75%]

==== _Rnd flame-generator_

Choose here the random-flame-generator used to generate a batch of random flames.
A random-flame-generator is a set of instructions to generate a skeleton of a certain type of fractal
and fill this skeleton with random values or random sub-structures.
What works good and what works not, depends on the type of fractals. Sometimes it just the
random change of some single number, sometimes a random transformation or formula is inserted.

Usually, the random-flame-generators of JWildfire use the strategy, to use some well-explained
ranges of parameters together with some larger freedom. This way you get very often a pleasing result,
but maybe also new variations, which you never saw before (or which may never been tried before at all).

There are two types of random-flame-generators:

 - *meta-random-flame-generator*: uses randomly-chosen random-flame-generators internally
 - *random-flame-generator*: actually creates a random flame

===== The special "All"-random-flame-generator
The most common random-flame-generator is the default generator named "All".
It is a meta-random-flame-generator and containes all other other random-flame-generators.
When it generates a random flame, it selects randomly one of those internal generators
to do the actual work.
So, by choosing "(All)" you will get the most diverse results.

==== Rnd Symmetry
Sets the random-symmetry-generator used for generating random flames.
A random-symmetry randomly sets post-symmetry-options of the random flames.

There are the following options:

 - *None*: the flame will have no post-symmetry
 - *XAxis*: a random x-axis-symmetry
 - *YAxis*: a random y-axis-symmetry
 - *Point*: a random point-axis-symmetry
 - *(All)*: randomly selects a random-symmetry-generator to generate post-symmetry
 - *(All, sparse)*: like *(All)*, but with reduced probability to generate post-symmetry at all

The default value is *(All, sparse)*, which means to randomly create random symmetry of all types,
but only a few random flames.

See the section about _Post symmetry_ for more details about the types of post-symmetry and related parameters.

==== Rnd Gradient
Set the random-gradient-generator used for generating random flames.

There are the following options:

- *(All)*: meta-random-gradient-generator which randomly chooses a random-gradient-generator to create the gradient
- *Strong hue*: creates a smooth  gradient with strong colors
- *Stripes*: creates a gradient with many regular color changes, having a "stripy" look
- *Monochrome*: creates a smooth and monochrome radient
- *Smooth*: creates a smooth gradient with primarily pastel colours
- *Bold*: creates a non-smooth gradient with large blocks of strong colors
- *Two colors*: creates a smooth gradient by fading exactly two colors into each other
- *Uniform curves*: creates a random color curve with evenly distributed base colors and then
derives the gradient from it. Using this generator you have both a gradient and
matching color curves.
- *Uneven curves*: creates a random color curve with unevenly distributed base colors.
Using this generator you have both a gradient and matching color curves.

The default setting is _Uneven curves_, which creates usually the most interesting and
versatile gradients together with the corresponding color curves.

==== Rnd WField
Set the random-weighting-field-generator used for generating random flames.

There are the following options:

 - *Cellular Noise*: create random weighting-fields using Cellular Noise
 - *Basic Noise*: create random weighting-fields using basic noise, like Perlin noise
 - *Fractal Noise*: create random weighting-fields using fractal noise, like Perlin fractal noise.
Fractal noise means to apply one type of noise multiple times at different scales.
 - *Image Map*: create random weighting-fields using an image map.
Per default always the same fixed internal map is used. You can exchange it by editing the flame afterwards.
 - *(All)*: randomly selects a random-weighting-field-generator to generate weighting-fields
 - *(All, sparse)*: like *(All)*, but with reduced probability to generate weighting-fields at all

[#new_from_scratch]
==== New from scratch
Create a new and empty flame with a random gradient. This is usually the first step when creating a fractal
manually "from scratch", hence the name.

==== From clipboard
Load a flame which was stored in the clipboard.

In social-media it is common to exchange flame-files in text-form by posting them. When loading such a flame
you usually copy the text and the use the _From clipboard_ button to load into JWildfire.

==== Load flame
Load a flame from a file and display it in the _Thumbnail ribbon_.

Flame files can also contain a batch of flames. In this case each flame from the flame-batch-file will be
imported as individual flame, which is displayed as individual thumbnail in the _Thumbnail ribbon_.
Each individual flame  of such a batch also has its own undo-history.

==== To clipboard
Stores the currently selected flame in text-form in the Clipboard.

In social-media it is common to exchange flame-files in text-form by posting them.
Using this function you may export your flame to paste it somewhere, e.g. at Facebook.

==== Save flame
Save the currently selected flame.

==== Q (Quicksave)
Quicksaves the currently selected flame by automatically generating a filename in the
form *"qsave_" + <Date> + <Counter> +".flame"* in the default flame folder.
You may set the default flame folder in the <<preferences, _Preferences_>> by changing the property *tinaFlamePath* .

==== A (Save all)
Save all selected flames together into one flame. Selected flames are indicated by a small checkmark at the
right upper edge of the thumbnail. See the sub-section <<selecting_flames_thumbnail_ribbon, _Selecting flames in the thumbnail ribbon_>>
for more informations about selecting flames.

==== Render image
Render the current flame using the selected <<quality_profiles, _quality_>> and <<resolution_profiles, _resolution profile_>>.

Rendering means to create a final image and consists of the following steps:

 - perform the fractal iteration process, possibly using internal a larger resolution than the desired image resolution.
See _Spatial oversampling_ for details.
 - perform tone-mapping by turning the raw fractal information into colored pixels.
See the section about the _Coloring tab_ for more details.
 - optionally perform AI-based denoising. See _AI-based denoiser_ for more details.

The rendering runs in the background and can be cancelled at anytime. But, you can not render
more than flame at once at this place. For rendering multiple images see the section about _Batch renderer_.

==== _Render resolution_ combobox
Here you choose the desired render resolution by choosing a _Resolution profile_.
JWildfire comes with some predefined _resolution profiles_, but you can completely customize them.

Even when you do not render the flame in the main editor, the correct render resolution should be
specified because of the aspect ratio. After changing a _resolution profile_, JWildfire will change the
size of the preview-area accordingly to the aspect ratio of the selected _resolution profile_.
For example, when you select a profile with same width and height, you will have a preview-area
of square shape.

[#resolution_profiles]
==== Edit _resolution profiles_
In this popup-window you may alter existing _resolution profiles_ as well as creating your own.

There are the following parameters:

 - *Width* x *Height*: image resolution
 - *Default profile*: one profile can be defined as the default profile. The profile is chosen when you start JWildfire.

==== _Render quality_ combobox
Here you choose the desired render quality as well as some output options by choosing a _Quality profile_.
JWildfire comes with some predefined _quality profiles_, but you can completely customize them.

Especially, when using a AI-based post-denoiser, you may want to revisit your quality profiles.
Such a denoiser can help to create visual appealing results with much lower quality settings
in order to reduce render time. The default settings are thought to be used without such an denoiser.
See the sub-chapter _AI-based denoiser_ for more details.

_Quality profiles_ also contain the information which type of images should be generated.
For example, you may specify inside a _quality profile_ that JWildfire shall generate an additional z-buffer-image
when using solid rendering.

[#quality_profiles]
==== Edit _quality profiles_
In this popup-window you may alter existing _quality profiles_ as well as creating your own.

There are the following parameters:

- *Quality*: quality level
- *with HDR*: create an additional _High Dynamic Range Image_ in .hdr-format.
Such an image contains raw colors in a much more precise way than conventional images.
But, it can usually not be displayed without special software.
Is is similar to an RAW-image in photography.
- *with Z-Buffer*: create an additional z-buffer-image. Together with the actual image of the fractal you can
create "3d wiggle images" which are/where popular on some social media platforms like Facebook.
Currently, this is only implemented for fractals rendered in solid mode.
- *Default profile*: one profile can be defined as the default profile. The profile is chosen when you start JWildfire.

==== Batch renderer
Quick-saves the currently selected fractal flame and sends it to the <<batch_renderer, _Batch renderer_>>.

Please note, that this does not actually render the fractal flame.
You must later open the _Batch renderer_ and invoke the rendering process.
So, it is just a shortcut to simplify adding fractal flames to the rendering batch.

Hint: when you continue to  edit the fractal flame and create a quicksave again, the _Batch renderer_
will still render the quicksave you did send to the _Batch renderer_ before.

== _MutaGen_ module
[.thumb]
image::MutaGen.jpg[scaledwidth=75%]

In this module you may create mutations of a certain flame in an interactive way.

There are several mutation types affecting different "genes" (types of flame properties).
Those mutations are applied at two levels: generation A (8 new fractals from the base flame)
and generation B (16 new fractals from generation A), generating total 24 new flames at each mutation step.

You can easily exchange fractals between the main editor and the new module at any time.

There is also a history, i.e. you can navigate back to earlier generations at any time.

See the section about <<quick_mutation_types, _Quick mutation types_>> for a description of available mutation types.

== _Interactive Renderer_ module
[.thumb]
image::interactive_renderer.jpg[scaledwidth=75%]

The _Interactive Renderer_ is an alternative rendering module which focuses on rendering a single image.
(In contrast, the _Batch Renderer_ focuses on rendering multiple images.)
_Interactive Renderer_ has three main purposes:

 - watch the rendering process for important artworks and let it render "until it is done"
 - explore random fractal flames and watch them get rendered clear and clearer. This may be very relaxing
 - explore the fractal rendering process in general

=== Saving the image while rendering
While rendering is in progress you may save a snapshot of the current image at any time.
This will not influence or even interrupt the ongoing rendering process in any way and is
an intended workflow.

=== Stats
When turning on the gathereing statistics you will not see the image becoming clearer and clearer the longer
the rendering process last, you will also get information about the current quality level together with
predictions when to reach certain quality levels.

You may turn gathering Stats of when you are not interested in any way. This will improve render
performance only slightly, though.

=== Preview
While previewing the image during rendering is a key-feature of the _Interactive Renderer_, it also
slightly slows down rendering. So, when you are not interested for an update of the display, you may pause
the Preview, e.g. when overnight.

=== From Editor
Imports the currently edited fractal flame from the _Main Editor_ and start rendering it.

*Please beware, that this will cancel any ongoing render and you will lose any unsaved results.*

=== From Clipboard
Imports a fractal flame from the clipboard and start rendering it.

*Please beware, that this will cancel any ongoing rendering and you will lose any unsaved results.*

=== Load flame
Loads a fractal flame from a flame start rendering it.

*Please beware, that this will cancel any ongoing rendering and you will lose any unsaved results.*

=== Resume render
Load a previously saved <<render_state, _Render State_>> and start rendering it.

*Please beware, that this will cancel any ongoing rendering and you will lose any unsaved results.*

=== Stop
Stops the currently ongoing rendering process.

*Please beware, that the render can not be resumed. You must save the <<render_state, _Render State_>>
when you want to be able to continue a render.*

=== 1:2
Sets the render size to the half of the currently selected render size. Can help to get a quick preview
when rendering at huge resolutions.

=== 1:4
Sets the render size to the quarter of the currently selected render size. Can help to get a quick preview
when rendering at huge resolutions.

=== Full
Use the full render resolution of the selected <<resolution_profiles, _Resolution Profile>>.
This is the default setting.

=== Resolution
Desired render resolution. See the sub-section about <<resolution_profiles, _Resolution Profiles_>>
for defining custom resolutions.

[#render_state]
=== Save render state
Save the current state in a proprietary format. You may load this file later to continue rendering
at exactly the same step.

=== Save image
Create a snapshot of the current render and save it as image.

=== Z (Save Z-Buffer)
Create a snapshot of the current render and save it as z-buffer. Currently z-buffers are only
supported when rendering in <<solid_rendering, solid mode>>.

=== Autoload saved image
When this option is checked, JWildfire will automatically load and display images created by
_Save image_- and the _Z (Save Z-Buffer)_-function.
To view the actual final image may help help better to decide when "it's done" that to view the rendering-preview.

=== To Editor
Transfer the currently rendered flame to the Main editor. May make sense when you resumed a render by and want to
edit the flame itself.

=== To Clipboard
Transfer the currently rendered flame to the clipboard. May make sense when you resumed a render by and want to
save the flame itself.

=== Save Flame
Save the currently rendered flame to file. May make sense when you resumed a render by and want to
save the flame itself.

=== Next (random flame)
Creates a random flame and starts rendering it.

*Please beware, that this will cancel any ongoing rendering and you will lose any unsaved results.*

=== Random generator
Select the random-flame-generator used to generate a random-fractal-flame when using the _Next_-button.

== Flame Browser
[.thumb]
image::flame_browser.jpg[scaledwidth=75%]

The flame-browser can help you to get an overview over your fractal flames you create over the time.
It can scan a base-folder for flame-files and displays them as thumbnails in reverse chronologinal order.
For a cleaner structure, for each month a separate virtual folder is created and flames are distributed over
this folder-structure.

On the right side of the window you can execute one of the following actions on the selected flame:

 - *To Editor*: load the selected flame into the _Main Editor_
 - *To Batch Renderer*: send the selected flame into the _Batch renderer_
 - *To Mesh Gen*: send the selected flame into the _Mesh generator_
 - *Delete*: delete the selected flame
 - *Rename...*: rename the selected flame
 - *Copy to...*: copy the selected flame into another folder
 - *Move to...*: move the selected flame into another folder

[#quilt_renderer]
== _Quilt Renderer_ module
[.thumb]
image::quilt_renderer.jpg[scaledwidth=75%]

The _Quilt Renderer_ allows you to render flames in nearly unlimited size.
This works by splitting the whole image into tiles.

You may freely specify how the tiles are generated, e.g. splitting the image in 3x2 tiles or 8 vertical stripes.

Each of the rendered tiles is a valid image.So, even if JWildfire would finally fail to assemble the tiles into one
final image (due to memory restrictions), you could perform this step using external image-processing-software,
which is more optimized to handle large images.
Images with a size upto 32K (30720x17280) where tested without any problems so far.

You can cancel/resume the rendering-process at tile-level.

Please note: Due to the nature of the fractal-flame-algorithm, the rendering of each tile may take as long as you
would render the whole image at once.So, this method is not efficient, but effective.
A 16K render on a modern computer can take about 12 hours, but you will usually get an awesome
result with endless details.

== _Mesh generator_ module
[.thumb]

???

== _GPU render_ module
[.thumb]
image::gpu_render.jpg[scaledwidth=75%]

GPU rendering in JWildfire is enabled by integrating FAEngine, an GPU-rendering-engine,
created by Steven Brodhead.

=== Limitations
Currently, the engine is limited in terms of features (e.g. supported variations) and
supported frameworks, but it actually works. And, it works very well.

For now, it only supports the Windows-platform, uses OpenCl and has a very limited
set of features (in comparison to the full JWildfire application, e.g. 3D-rendering
is completely missed).

=== Requirements
You will need a modern graphics card with plenty of memory to make out the most of this
stuff.

=== Installation
The FAEngine comes as a separate package, you must download separately. This enables us to
update it more often than the main JWildfire application, if required.

The overall installation is simple:

 . Download the recent FACLRender-package from http://www.andreas-maschke.com/
 . Extract the download *.zip-file to some permanent path on you hard-disk, preferably
not on the Desktop, e. g. on D:\Program Files\FACLRender.
If you look into this folder, you should see a file FACLRender.exe
 . Start JWildfire and open the <<preferences, _Preferences_>>-window. Locate the property named
tinaFACLRenderPath and enter the path to folder which contains the FACLRender.exe.
In this example, enter "D:\Program Files\FACLRender"
  . Press the "Save and Close"-button and exit JWildfire
 . Start JWildfire again, now you should see a new entry "Fractal flames: GPU render"
in the main Window-menu (see section 3.).

==== Self-Test
To test the GPU-rendering itself (and to simplify further troubleshooting), please invoke
the self-test. Just enter the directory where you installed FACLRender and open the sub-folder
"selftest" ( In this example "D:\Program Files\FACLRender\selftest" ).
Double-click at the selftest.bat. If everything works as expected, you should see that
"selftest.png" was created. Otherwise, the console output hopefully helps to solve the
problem.

=== Rendering flames using the GPU
Use the "GPU renderer"-window to play with flames. This window works similar to the
Interactive renderer, you may import flames from the editor or load them from harddisc etc.

Most flames will not work flawless, as most flames have at least one feature which is not
supported by GPU-rendering at this time. But, of course, you will be able to create endless
beautiful flames, though.

=== Using the "Linear Only"-random-flame-generator
A good starting point is to use the "Linear Only"-random-flame-generator to create a batch
of flames which are guaranteed to work. Pick some nice one, transfer it to the GPU-render
and see how it performs. Add some feature, see if it is still supported by GPU, etc.

=== Batch rendering
When FACLRender is properly integrated into JWildfire there appears a new "GPU"-button
in the Batch-renderer. You may use it to render whole batches by using the GPU.
But, before you render a huge sequence, you should be sure that the flames do not use
features which are not supported by FACLRender. You may quickly do so by transfering
one of the flames to the "GPU renderer"-window and see if it works.

=== Troubleshooting
If rendering fails, you should check if the FACLRender.exe can detect any devices (or is
missing some vital library, for example). To do so, open a console/terminal window
and enter the directory where the FACLRender.exe resides.
Enter the command:
FACLRender
If the programm can be started at all, it should output a list of options, one of then
being "-list"

So, enter the command:
FACLRender -list
to get a list of detected devices. When something is wrong, you hopefully will get some
useful information displayed here.

==== Visual C++ Redistributable for Visual Studio 2015
If some *.dlls are missing, installing the the
  "Visual C++ Redistributable for Visual Studio 2015"-Kit
from Microsoft will help in the most cases.

==== OpenCl drivers
Also, be sure to have OpenCl-drivers for your graphics card installed.

== _IFlames_ module
[.thumb]
image::iflames.jpg[scaledwidth=75%]

This is an experimental application which combines particle simulation and fractal flames.

It requires a rather powerful computer, especially when you want to animate the iflames.

There are about 350-parameters to change, many of them may be animated:

- *Edge-finding*: controls where to place base-shapes
- *Global structure*: controls the global structure of the resulting iflame
- *Blending*: controls coloring
- *Dynamics*: controls global settings affecting dynamics aspects, like gravity
- *Base Flame Appearance*: controls the base-shapes inside an iflame (you may have upto 6 different base-shapes)
- *Size and orientation*: The size and oriantation of the base-shapes
- *Distribution*: how to place which base-shape
- *Blending*: local coloring
- *Mutations*: controls how to create mutations from the base-shapes
- *Dynamics*: dynamic properties (like speed in a certain direction) of base-shapes

[#preferences]
== _Preferences_ window
[.thumb]
image::preferences.jpg[scaledwidth=75%]

In the _Preferences_-window you may customize JWildfire to your needs.

The customizable properties are key-value pairs which are displayed in one large table.
You may edit a property by double-clicking at the value in the 2nd column of the table.

Each property has a small description which is displayed at the bottom of the window.

[.thumb]
image::preferences_property_description.jpg[scaledwidth=75%]

Depending on the type of a property a popup-dialog may appear or you may edit the value in place.
For example, when editing properties of type color, a color-selection-dialog appears.

Some properties may be changed "on the fly", others will need a restart of JWildfire in order
to show an effect. This is usually mentioned in the description of the property.

== Platform-specific topics (Windows, Mac, Steam, ...)
???

== FAQ (frequently asked questions)
Here are answers to some popular questions which I get very often. They seem not fit well into
the other chapters, so I collected them in this section.

[#rendering_in_4k]
=== Are 4k renders possible?
Yes, you can.

You can literally render in any resolution, also 8k:

- by rendering a single image at once. The maximum render size is only restricted by your available memory.
(For really huge images, you may need patience, too.)
- by using the <<quilt_renderer, _Quilt-renderer_>>-module you may render really huge images in smaller parts, which are finally
assembled together. The maximum render size is also limited by memory. But often, you will
get other problems before reaching the memory-limit in JWildfire. For example, those image files can be very big (I have tested with
sizes up to 1 GB), and is hard to find other software which may process such large images.

=== Can I render images with removed/transparent background?
Yes, you can.

See the properties _Background transparency_ and _Fg opacity_ at the _Coloring_-tab.

You can also preview the rendering with transparent background. Set the _Display/hide transparency_ - button
at the preview-area.

=== How to save a flame as image?
You can not directly save a flame as an image. You must _render_ a flame in order
to generate an image. There are multiple options you can specify for rendering (for example: the output resolution),
so you can get out different images out of one fractal flame.

=== Is it possible to render flames at higher resolutions than inside JWildfire?
There are no restrictions regarding render size which could resolved by an external
application for rendering. The only limitation is memory.
See <<rendering_in_4k, Are 4k renders possible?>> for more informations.
